Advanced Bioinformatics Assignment

NGS pipeline provided via a bash script
N.B.; although the pipeline is fully completed, limited disk space has meant that full runthrough tests were unable to be conducted.
I have included the annovar annotation steps within the pipeline, but they no not run on my openstack instance.
This is because annovar takes up too much memory to be able to complete tasks upstream, such as the .sam to .bam conversion.
The bash script is heavily commented to explain this.

RStudio tasks provided in both markdown files (.rmd) and HTML format (.html)
N.B.; the HTML file when opened only displays as raw data.
